## User Story

```
As a diabetic I want an easy and polished app to use 

So that I can track my blood sugar levels and not feel off during my day

As a diabetic I also want an easy to use application 

That helps remind me about my medication intake.

```



## About the Project



The Glucose Guardians is a React application built for people with type 1 and 2 diabetics to track their blood sugar, medications and more. This makes it easy to identify blood sugar trends and retain your data. You can also schedule reminders to ensure that you are diligent about checking your blood sugar. Whether you have diabetes or prediabetes, this app makes it easy to track your blood glucose levels.

## Future Developments 

We want to expand on this project! There is lots of room to grow and keep updating and debugging. Our next step is to make it into a mobile application with react native. 

Here are some ideas we have for future developemnts: 

* Make it into a mobile application. Move the Navbar to the bottom of app to make it as user friendly as possible.
